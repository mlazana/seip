The purpose of this assignment is to get familiar with built automation tools and some Java libraries. More precisely, I created a Java-based project with Maven. This progamme reads grades from a given file and presents a histogram with the frequencies.

An example:

Let's say that I give the following grades.txt :

Then the output would be like this:
